# RedRiver_TimeVaryingSA

This repository contains the code and results used to generate Figures 3-8 and S1-S9 of [Quinn et al. (2019)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018WR024177):

Quinn, J.D., Reed, P.M., Giuliani, M., and Castelletti, A. (2019). What is controlling our control rules? Opening the black box of multi-reservoir operating policies using time-varying sensitivity analysis. *Water Resources Research*. *55*, 1--23. doi: 10.1029/2018WR024177

Figure 1 is the same as Figure 2 from [Quinn et al. (2017)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017WR020524/full), and the code used to make it can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/julianneq/RedRiver_RivalFramings.

Figure 2 was made manually in Adobe Illustrator.

The data for several figures is too large to share over Github, but can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H-n9oljcyC1F1Uq5BseSsIwQWVY5XwGj). Pasting the files within `RedRiver_TimeVaryingSA/guidelines_100` and `RedRiver_TimeVaryingSA/HydroInfo_100` of that Google Drive folder to the corresponding folders of this repository will enable all figures to be plotted.
